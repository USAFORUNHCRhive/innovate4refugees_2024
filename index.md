## Kakuma and Kalobeyei Mapping Project Overview
According to the UN Refugee Agency’s (UNHCR) 2023 Global Trends Report, approximately 22% of the 43 million refugees around the world live in camps — temporary facilities built to respond to specific emergencies. As the need for refugee housing grows, planning for refugee settlements has become more complex. To address this growing need, UNHCR is partnering with the tech sector to see how modern advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can be part of the solution.

To demonstrate how AI can address some of the most pressing issues in the humanitarian sector, Microsoft began a program in 2020 called AI for Humanitarian Action. The Hive, USA for UNHCR’s data science and innovation lab, supported this initiative by conducting research to better understand what kinds of high-impact problems could be addressed with AI. Solutions for refugee settlement planning was one of the ideas that emerged from the work.

The Hive’s research helped guide Microsoft’s investment strategy for its 2021 call for proposals which encouraged applicants to focus on the problems, not potential solutions; partner with stakeholders who would implement potential solutions; and ensure that underrepresented and affected persons were included in the project. UNHCR responded to the call and successfully received a grant from Microsoft by addressing the three criteria in the following ways:

1. The Problem: Humanitarian groups recognize that accurate and up-to-date maps are indispensable tools for enhancing the quality of life for communities in crisis. However, clear, accurate maps and aerial imagery of refugee settlements have not been easily available. Without access to maps, UNHCR field operations struggle to make informed decisions, plan for resource allocation and provide an improved standard of living for the residents of the camps.
2. The Implementing Agencies: In addition to UNHCR Kenya, several other implementing agencies, such as the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) and the Kenyan government, responsible for sheltering refugees could benefit from accurate and up-to-date maps. Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOT), an international team dedicated to humanitarian action and community development through open mapping, was the perfect partner to ensure open access to such data and imagery.
3. Inclusion of Refugees: Throughout the development of the project idea and during implementation, refugees living in Kakuma refugee camp and Kalobeyei settlement in Kenya were involved in the process. One unique aspect of participation was that refugee residents were trained to use open mapping technology that would not only generate critical inputs for the models but would also help trainees gain a valuable skill for the future.

## The Solution
Leverage advances in drone imagery to create open, accessible high resolution maps and use AI to help UNHCR field operations plan more accurately.

The ability to fly, store and use drone imagery was part of the innovative approach when compared to traditional satellite imagery. Over the course of the project, 102 drone flights, spanning 8.4K hectares, captured 161K images of data (near 3 terabytes). The images for Kakuma and Kalobeyei are available as part of HOT’s Open Aerial Map platform.

The higher resolution provides better data for AI models to achieve previously impossible levels of recognition of features on the ground such as tents, solar panels, latrines or even light poles. Mappers were trained to tag features in the images using an open-source tool called the HOT Task Manager that creates clear ways for both refugees in the camp and volunteers from around the world to work together. Over the course of several week, everyone worked to identify features within the camps including those listed above and even animal shelters, waste disposal areas, and community gathering spaces.

Once HOT’s mappers created the sample of features tagged, Microsoft AI for Good research scientists built 4 machine-learning models to automate the tagging for the other parts of the camp not tagged by mappers. The open-source code is available on GitHub for developers and civic technologists to use . Participants of The Hive’s annual forum #Innovate4Refugees during the UN General Assembly week in September 2024 will be shown ways to use these models (see below).

Based on an ongoing Memorandum of Understanding between HOT and UNHCR Kenya, the maps and models are being used by the UNHRC operations team and implementing partners, including the Kenyan Government and organizations involved in sheltering refugees.

## The Event
### Innovate4Refugees: Data and Tech Solutions Forum 2024 Hosted by The Hive at USA for UNHCR
Sep 25, 2024
1:30-2:45PM Eastern Time (Hybrid)

### Workshop Objective
To help participants gain empathy for use of AI for better understanding of camp features for settlement planning, understand the modeling process and potential use (direct and/or indirect)

### Leads
Amrita and Simone (Microsoft) Seema, Jon, Elaine (The Hive) DK Benjamin (HOT OSM)

### Workshop takeaways
1) Raise awareness of AI for imagery for settlement planning
2) Understand the role of AI for rapid assessment of changing environments
3) Identify ways to further collaborate with project team
4) Encourage at least 5-7 people follow The Hive’s GitHub repo
